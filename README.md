2. Use the generated library to write main.cpp as server, the included library was used to do RPC(Remote Procedure Code)

3. The main.cpp functions was designed to implement textLCD code(void locate(int column, int row); and void putc(int c))

3. Write a python code as a client, use the client python code to control the Mbed server.
